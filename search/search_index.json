Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a *.json* file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more ***placeholders***. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"es/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Traducir la documentaci\u00f3n","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

It consumes Ki whilst flying, the Ki consumption is based on the skill level, the higher the level, the less Ki consumed, up to level 8, where it stops consuming Ki.

If you have the skill leveled up, you can continue holding G key to increase the Kaioken Multiplier!

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"af/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ar/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Instructions for creating a new translation","text":"<p>There are two ways to create new translation files for DragonMine Z:</p> <ol> <li>By using Crowdin to translate each json string manually with help of translating AI.</li> <li>Copying the original <code>en_us.json</code> file and translating every string manually and then uploading the translated file to Crowdin.</li> </ol> <p>Crowdin automatically offers a guide on how to translate a language, below are the instructions for translating the Minecraft mod using the second method above.</p> <ol> <li>Copy the <code>en_us.json</code> file from the <code>lang</code> folder in the mod's source code repository/crowdin project.</li> <li>Rename the file to the language code you want to translate to. Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ca/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cs/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Instructions for creating a new translation","text":"<p>There are two ways to create new translation files for DragonMine Z:</p> <ol> <li>By using Crowdin to translate each json string manually with help of translating AI.</li> <li>Copying the original <code>en_us.json</code> file and translating every string manually and then uploading the translated file to Crowdin.</li> </ol> <p>Crowdin automatically offers a guide on how to translate a language, below are the instructions for translating the Minecraft mod using the second method above.</p> <ol> <li>Copy the <code>en_us.json</code> file from the <code>lang</code> folder in the mod's source code repository/crowdin project.</li> <li>Rename the file to the language code you want to translate to. Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"da/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"de/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"el/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"fi/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"he/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"hu/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"it/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ja/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ko/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"nl/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"pl/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"pt/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ro/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ru/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sr/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sv/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tr/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"uk/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"vi/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.

Acording to the Locale Code used by Mojang, for example: <code>fr_fr.json</code>.</li> <li>Make sure to keep the same structure and format of the original file.</li> <li>The .json file must be saved using a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding. We recommend using Notepad++.</li> </ol> <p>If your language uses a character set which needs to be handled with Unicode characters, you can type them directly into the file. There is no longer a need to use Unicode hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference (NCR) codes (like \\u0202).</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n\"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\\u60A8\\u5DF2\\u6DFB\\u52A0 %d \\u70B9\\u5230...\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"\u60a8\u5df2\u6dfb\u52a0 %d \u70b9\u5230...\" <pre><code>### **III. How to translate a _.json_ file**\n\n- Open the .json file with a text editor that supports UTF-8 encoding, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You'll see a structure like this:\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.add\": \"You added %d points to...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.remove\": \"You removed %d points from...\",\n  \"commands.dmz.dmzpoints.set\": \"You set %d points to...\"\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Translate the text on the right side of the colon <code>:</code>. Do not translate the text on the left side of the colon <code>:</code>.   Example:</li> </ul> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"This is an example translation\" <pre><code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;**Incorrect**&lt;/span&gt;**:**\n\n```{.json\n  \"commands.dmz.exemple.traduction\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Correct:</p> <p>```{.json   \"commands.dmz.example.translation\": \"Ceci est une traduction d'exemple\" <pre><code>- Many strings contain one or more _**placeholders**_. For example, `%d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a number when the string is displayed; and `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced by a string. Also, some strings contain color codes, `\\u00A7` is referred to as the section sign, `\u00a7`, the color code formatting character in Minecraft. You can see the [color codes here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes), to make this work, you have to follow the color code by a letter or number, for example, `\\u00A7b` will make the text blue, while `\\u00A7r` will reset the color to white.\n  You **must** keep these placeholders in the translated text, but you have the freedom to reorder these parameters if it is required by the grammar rules of your language. For Example:\n\n```{.json\n    \"command.dmzpoints.set\": \"You have \\u00A7bset \\u00A7rthe %s's points to %d.\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>When the above phare is displayed ingame, the placeholders will be replaced by actual ingame values, like this:</p> <p>\"You have set the ezShokkoh's points to 1750.\"</p> <p>Remember:</p> <ul> <li>Do not add line breaks or HTML to any of the strings.</li> <li>Do not translate or remove the special characters combinations used by Minecraft to change colors. (\\u00A7b = \u00a7b) - Crowdin will check for these errors if you are uploading the translations there.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"zh/contributing/translatedocs/","title":"Translate the Docs","text":"<p>If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language.
