## Introduction

DragonMine Z is an immersive WIP (Work-In-Progress) [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) mod inspired by Akira
Toriyama's most-famous work, [Dragon Ball](https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/).

Our plan is to take the complete Dragon Ball experience into Minecraft **1.20.1**, adding everything we can and
revamping the vanilla experience.
