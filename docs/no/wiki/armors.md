DragonMine Z has a big variety of armors, all of them have the same stats, due to being crafted with the exact same materials, but they have different appearances based on the DragonBall Z characters and their outfits!
For example, we have various `Goku` armors, the Classic one, the Classic one with the King Kai's Symbol, the Yardrat one, the DBSuper one and the DBGT one!

## **Obtaining**

You can obtain a `Goku` and a `Goten` armor by going inside the `Goku House` structure in a Plains Biome.
Other armors can be obtained only by crafting them, using the `Dr. Kikono's Armor Station`!

To craft the `Armor Station`, you'll need to obtain a Netherite Pickaxe and go to `Namek` to mine some `Kikono Ore`, which is the only way to obtain `Kikono Shard`.
Once you crafted the `Armor Station`, you can use it to craft the armors!
With the `Kikono Shards` and an `Armor Crafting Kit`, you'll be able to craft `Kikono String` and `Kikono Cloth`.
Craft you favorite armor `Pattern` with Paper and Dyes, and then use the `Armor Station` to craft the armor!
