# Important Items
##### **This page is a work in progress. It is incomplete and will have many changes in the future.**

This page will provide a brief overview of the useful items in the Mod. Note that this page is not a complete list of all the items in the Mod, but rather a list of the most useful ones; for example, normal items like `Goku Armor Chestplate`, `Yajirobe Sword`, etc, are not included in this page.

### **1. Dragon Radar**
The Dragon Radar is used to locate the Dragon Balls, it can be crafted with some simple materials, like Iron and Redstone.  
Once you have the Dragon Radar in your inventory, you just have to hold it in your hand (or offhand) and you will see the Dragon Radar overlay, locating the Dragon Balls in the world.  
The overlay is simple:  
- If you don't have any Dragon Ball near, you'll see yellow arrows pointing to the Dragon Balls.
- If you have any Dragon Ball near, you'll see a yellow dot marking the Dragon Ball.

Also, like the Anime, you can't increase or decrease the Dragon Ball Radar tracking range by ++rbutton++ (right-clicking) it.

### **2. Capsules**
The Capsules are items used to increase by `+5` your stats, they can not be crafted and can only be obtained by wishing them to Shenron or Porunga.  
There are 5 types of Capsules, each one increasing a different stat. In order to use it you have to, obviously, have your character created.  
You should see a little message when you consume the Capsule, saying that your stats have been increased.
If you don't see this message, it means that you have your stat maxed, or that you haven't created your character yet.

In the future, we may add a way to obtain Capsules without having to wish them to Shenron or Porunga, maybe trading it with Namekians or something like that.

### **3. Foods**
The Foods included by **DragonMine Z**, along with the normal uses, like refilling your hunger bar, have some special uses.  
Every food restores a little percent of your Max Ki, Max Health and Max Stamina, each food restoring a different amount of each stat; obviously, the better the food, the more it restores.  
Along with some foods, there's other items that also heals you, like Senzu Beans, which restores all your bars to the max, and the Heart Medicine, which has the same effect.

### **4. Special Items**
The Special Items are items that have a unique use.  
Currently, there's only one that has a function, but in the future we may add more: 
- **Fruit of the Tree of Might**: When you consume it, you will get a buff that multiplies all your stats by `x1.2` for 5 minutes.
     - Notes: You can only consume one Fruit of the Tree of Might at a time, if you have the buff and consume another one, the buff will be refreshed, but not stacked.
     - The buff will be removed if you die, so be careful!
- **Pothalas**: Currently, the Pothalas are implemented but they don't have any use yet. In the future, we're planning to add a way to fuse with another player using the Pothalas, but we're still discussing how it will work and how it will be balanced!
