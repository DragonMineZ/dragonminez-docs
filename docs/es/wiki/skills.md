## **Skills**
In DragonMine Z, skills are a big part of the game. They allow to do many things, such as increasing your power level, jumping higher, and more. There are a few skills in the game, and each one has its own unique effects.

### 1. **Obtain a Skill**
There's two ways to obtain a skill:
    1. Using the `/dmzskills <give|set|take> <skill_id> <level> <player>` command, more explained in the [Commands](servers/commands.md) section.
    2. Talking to the specific npc that teaches the skill. For example, to learn the `Potential Unlock` skill, you have to talk to King Kai.

### 2. **View your Skills**
To view your skills, press the ++v++ key to open the Stats Menu, then, click on the Skills button, there you can see all your skills and their levels.  
There you will be able to see the skill's level, name, status and a new `i` button that opens a new Description Panel to see the skill's description, TP Cost to level up, and delete the skill if you want.  
You will also be able to have information about your `Racial Passive Skill`.  
In this same menu, you can also switch between the Skill Status (depending on the skill, not all skills have this feature) by clicking on the `Switch` button.

### 3. **Use a Skill**
Most skills are passive, so they will be automatically activated once you learn them.  
But some skills are active, so you have to either activate them by pressing a key or by switching the skill status in the Stats Menu.

1. **Meditation**: Meditation is a passive skill that increases the Passive Ki Regeneration, Passive Stamina Regeneration and Ki Charge whilst holding the charge key.  
2. **Jump**: Jump is a passive skill that increases the jump height of the player, it's automatically activated once you learn it, but you can switch it off in the Stats Menu.  
3. **Ki Control**: Ki Control by itself doesn't do anything, but it's a requirement to learn other skills, such as the `Ki Manipulation` skill, and techniques in the future. Will also decrease the Ki Consumption of the Ki Techniques.  
4. **Ki Manipulation**: Ki Manipulation is an active skill that allows you to manipulate your Ki to create `Ki Weapons`, such as the `Sword`, `Scythe` or the `Claw Lance`. To activate it, you have to press the switch button in the Stats Menu, then, press the `=` button next to the switch button to switch between the Ki Weapons. Each Ki Weapon deals different damage and consumes different Ki amounts.  
5. **Potential Unlock**: Potential Unlock is a passive skill that allows you to increase your Power Level by 50% more than the maximum, allowing you to reach 100% of your Power Level. It is active by default and can't be switched off.  
6. **Fly**: Fly is an active skill that allows you to fly by pressing the ++f++ key. It's automatically activated once you press the ++f++ key, and automatically deactivated once you land on the ground or press the ++f++ key again to stop flying. It consumes Ki whilst flying, the Ki consumption is based on the skill level, the higher the level, the less Ki consumed, up to level 8, where it stops consuming Ki. The movement speed is also based on the skill level, the higher the level, the faster you fly.  
7. **Kaioken**: Kaioken works very different to other skills. To switch the activation you need to press the ++x++ key and switch it state in the right panel with the ++left++ and ++right++ arrow keys. Once you select it, you have to hold ++g++ key to activate it. If you have the skill leveled up, you can continue holding ++g++ key to increase the Kaioken Multiplier! For example: If you have Kaioken at level 10, you can hold ++g++ key to transform into Kaioken, then hold again to transform in Kaioken x2, then Kaioken x3, x4 and x20!
