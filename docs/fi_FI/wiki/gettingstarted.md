### Step 1: The Basics

1. **Make sure to select the Default World Type**.

   - Customize your character's appearance, colors, and fighting style.

   - Here you can see your character's stats, level, and TP.
   - First, you have to release your power, it's represented by the `0%` text in the top left corner.

   - To obtain your first **Training Points**, you need to punch or kill entities! Doesn't matter if it's a cow or a zombie, just punch it!
   - You can allocate your **Training Points** to increase your character's stats.
   - **Note**: If you're building `STR`, it's recommended to have the same `CON` to avoid consuming all your stamina in one hit, the less stamina you have, the less damage you deal, so be careful!

### Step 2: Explore the world!

   - Kami's Lookout spawns between `XZ: -1200 to 1200`. So it's very easy to find!

   - Once you have all 7 Dragon Balls, you can summon Shenron and make a wish! You can wish for Capsules that gives you a stat boost, or a Tier 2 Radar CPU. The Tier 2 Radar CPU allows you to craft the Namek Dragon Radar, so make sure to get it!
3. **Find Goku's House and Kame House**
   - If you searched the Dragon Balls, you probably found Goku's House, where you can find the 4th Dragon Ball!
   - You can talk to Goku to learn some Skills!
