## **Transformations**

In DragonMine Z, transformations are a big part of the game. They allow you to increase your power level and become stronger. There are a few transformations in the game, and each one has its own unique Stats Multiplier and Ki Consume.

### 1. **Obtain a transformation:**

There's three ways to obtain a transformation:
1. Using the `/dmzforms <give|set|take> <form_id> <level> <player>` command, more explained in the [Commands](servers/commands.md) section.
2. Or, depending on config, either buying it in the Transformations Menu pressing the ++v++ key, or advancing in the storyline.

### 2. **Select a transformation:**

To select a transformation, press the ++x++ key to display on the right side of the screen a small interface with some options, in the Forms section, you can switch between the selected transformation by pressing the ++left++ and ++right++ arrow keys.

### 3. **Transform:**

To transform into the selected transformation, hold the ++g++ key. You'll see your **Z** bar increasing, that's your _Form Release_. Once it reaches 100%, you'll transform into the selected transformation. If you're holding the ++g++ key and the **Z** bar doesn't increase, that means that you either have no Ki or you don't have any transformation selected.

In the future, you'll be able to transform instantly by pressing twice the ++g++ key, without having to hold it, but that's not implemented yet.

### 4. **De-transform:**

To de-transform, you just have to press the _Descend_ key and the _Transform_ key, by default, it's just ++alt+x++.

Also, in the future, you'll be able to de-transform instantly by pressing ++alt++ key twice, without having to combine it with ++g++ key, but that's not implemented yet.
