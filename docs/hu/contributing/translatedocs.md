If you want to contribute towards DragonMine Z, you can do so by translating the documentation into your language. This can help other people that do not speak English to be able to read the DragonMine Z Documentation and play the mod in their language.

Instructions on how to translate the Mod can be found [here](translate.md).

## Using Crowdin to translate

With the new addition of Crowdin to the project, now contributing to the documentation is available through Crowdin. Simply head to our [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/dragonminez) and select the language you want to translate. If your language is not listed, feel free to contact us on Discord.

Although your translations will not be automatically implemented, we will try to do our best to implement these as fast as possible.
